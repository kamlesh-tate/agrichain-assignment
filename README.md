Problem 1:

Program for following:
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. For example, the
longest substring without repeating letters for "abcabcbb" is "abc", for which the length is 3. For
"bbbbb" the longest substring is "b", with the length of 1
Note: You can choose a programming language of your own choice.

Problem 2:

Assume there is a website https://agrichain.com which does exactly the same thing as
problem 1, it takes the input on home page and then on click of submit button, it navigates to
different page where it prints the output for longest substring without repeating letters.

Write all test cases you would be doing to test the above website. Categorise those cases in
manual (you would be doing manually) and automation (you would be automating).

Write web automation script for any one test case that you have mentioned above with high level
automation framework(folder/directory structure) to explain which goes where (browser
initialisation, web elements, test scenario etc).

------Solution--------->  


        ----> Manual and Automation Test Cases are stored in the file paths in text format::

            1.TestCases_Manual&Automation/Problem2_ManualTestCase.txt
            2.TestCases_Manual&Automation/Problem2_AutomationTestCase.txt

        ----> I have written web automation script for below test case from the file ** Problem2_AutomationTestCase.txt ** and created automation framework::

            • Test Case ID: 1
            • Scenario: Valid Short String - Longest Non-Repeating Substring
